    "text": "As described in the quarto documentation: Quarto is a new, open-source, scientific, and technical publishing system. It is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from RStudio, with many new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses Knitr to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.\nData scientists are pretty excited about the introduction of Quarto, and since it represents the future of R Markdown, we will conduct SDS 264 using Quarto. Intriguing Quarto features that have been cited include:\nFrom Posit and the developers of Rstudio and Quarto https://charlotte.quarto.pub/cascadia/, Quarto (compared to RMarkdown):\nIn other words, Quarto unifies and extends R Markdown:\nHere’s a cool example from the Quarto documentation, showing features like cross-referencing of figures, chunk options using the hash-pipe format, collapsed code, and easy figure legends:",

    "text": "Overview\nWe will create our own personal quarto webpages to give you a forum for showing your data science portfolio, featuring projects from SDS 264 in addition to things you’ve worked on in other classes, independently, etc.\nWe will follow the excellent set of instructions prepared by Samantha Csik and others as part of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management’s Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program.\nI have found success starting at the top of working my way carefully through the steps outlined. I cannot emphasize this enough: be sure to NOT speed through the steps, but follow even the small, subtle suggestions, and stop and appreciate the useful insights given at various points in the process! Continue all the way through the end of the website!\n\n\nBig Picture\n\nWe’ll create .qmd files filled with the content of our website, styling the content with markdown (same as Rmd files).\nWe’ll render the .qmd files into .html files that we can host on a web server like GitHub Pages.\nMost people will create and publish a personal website using GitHub that is named username.github.io; in that case, you’ll have a website folder and a folder on your own computer both named username.github.io (e.g. proback.github.io).\n\n\n\nSpecifics\nYou will publish a personal quarto webpage that contains basic information about yourself, as well as a menu bar that contains, at a minimum, a link to your work from Mini-Project 1 on maps and Mini-Project 2 on data acquisition, and a link to your source code on GitHub.\nHere is a pretty basic example that I put together. I’m hoping you’ll put together something more impressive – taking advantage of features in quarto to create a look that you’re excited about and an organization and layout that cleanly highlights your good work. Check out this rubric for Mini-Project 3.\n\n\nSubmission and Timeline\nMini-Project 3 must be submitted on moodle by 11:00 PM on Fri Nov 1. All I need is a url for your webpage, which should then have a link to your R code in GitHub. If you choose not to make your webpage public at this time, please add me as a collaborator to your GitHub repository so that I can see your code and generate your webpage.\n\n\nAdditional Information\nQuarto Website Resources:\n\nQuarto Websites\nYAML basics in Quarto\nCreating Data Science Portfolios\n\nInspiration\nThe following Data Science sites were created with Quarto:\n\nhttps://bcheggeseth.github.io/temp_website/\nhttps://bcheggeseth.github.io/\n\nhttps://allisonhorst.github.io/\nhttps://samanthacsik.github.io/\nhttps://www.andreashandel.com/\nhttps://blog.djnavarro.net/ [published with Github but pushed to a custom domain]\nhttps://deepshamenghani.quarto.pub/dmenghani/ [published with Quarto pubs]\n\nCode Examples [if you see something in the sites above, try and find their github repo]:\n\nhttps://github.com/bcheggeseth/temp_website\nhttps://github.com/bcheggeseth/bcheggeseth.github.io\nhttps://github.com/allisonhorst/allisonhorst.github.io\nhttps://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io\nhttps://github.com/andreashandel/andreashandelwebsite",

Just as we found state-level data from both a vaccine data set and the poliscidata package, you should find your own state-level data that is interesting to you.\nA few additional details for this mini-project:\n\nYou should create two versions of each plot – one that is static and one that is interactive.\nBe sure to include a note on your plots with your data source.\nYou should be able to merge your state-level data with the state mapping data sets we used in class.\nBe sure you label your plot well and provide a description of what insights can be gained from each static plot. For one of your static plots, this should be in the form of alt-text, using the “Four Ingredient Model” in the article from class.\nCheck out this rubric for Mini-Project 1.\n\n\n\nSubmission and Timeline\nMini-Project 1 must be submitted on moodle by 11:00 PM on Fri Sep 20. You should submit your two static plots, along with descriptions and alt-text, in a pdf document. For your interactive plots, just submit a GitHub link where I can see your code that would produce a nice html document.

Create a tidy tibble that will allow you to perform desired analyses. This might involve stringr, mutate, filter, spread, parse_, etc. You should use functions and iteration techniques where appropriate, and code with good style and commenting.\n“Visualize it”. Create plots that effectively tell a story about what insights can be gained from your data.

Click “OK”.\nDelete the “Embedded Application” section at the end.\nSave the resulting file as “first_Shiny.Rmd”.\nCarefully examine the code, including the use of “echo = FALSE” to prevent R code from appearing in the Shiny app.\nHit “Run Document” to see the app. Now you are running a Shiny app through Rmarkdown!\n\n\n\nGroup exercise I:\n\nCreate a second interactive histogram which recreates the 1st histogram (old faithful eruption) as closely as possible using ggplot.\n\n\nHint 1: write ggplot code that works, and then “shiny-ize” it\nHint 2: Use aes(y = after_stat(density)) in the histogram to make histogram and density use same y-axis.\nHint 3: Give your input variables different names than in the first histogram.\n\n\nModify the input panel choices for number of bins and bandwidth. Also change the default/starting input for both bins and bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2:\nSee how a few more input features can be used in AER_Shiny.Rmd, which uses the medical expenditure data set NMES1988\n\nSave this file, then hit “Run Document” to see a few new features (note that you can’t simply run individual R chunks in an Rmd meant to produce a Shiny app)\nNote how a Yes/No check box can be integrated with if and else if\nNote how user-input variables for ggplot attributes can be integrated with .data[[.]]. In some of the sample code from past projects, you may see aes_string() used instead of .data[[.]]. aes_string() still works, but it was recently deprecated so it will no longer be supported in the tidyverse.\n\n\n\nGroup exercise II:\n\nCreate a new shiny app! Use a dataset from class that’s built into R (e.g., flights, diamonds, ames, NMES1988,…) and create an interactive graph. (Hint: you can see all of the built-in R data sets available to you from the packages currently loaded by running data())\nYou might try having multiple inputs, or examining the Shiny CheatSheet Input Options (https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) and using an input we haven’t discussed yet.\n\n\n\n\nLinks to other Rmd files we will use to produce interactive apps\nRemember to hit the Download Raw File button in each case.\n\n14a_AER_Shiny.Rmd\n14b_first_Shiny_flexdash.Rmd\n\nWe will also use these folders as well. You can copy the URL for the folder into the textbox at download-directory.github.io, hit Enter, and you’ll have a zipped version of the folder.\n\nAER_app\nAmes example\n\nCheck out my Shiny app on Ames Housing:\n\nClick here",

    "text": "Matching Patterns\nIn addition to manipulating strings, we might what to search through them to find matches. For example, can I find all the songs that start with M? The songs from 2016? The album titles that include a number?\n\nstr_view()\nThis function is helpful for viewing. It returns rows that contain the pattern you’re searching for, highlighting the pattern between &lt;.&gt; symbols and in a different color.\nThe first input is the vector, and the second input is the string/substring/pattern you are looking for.\n\nstr_view(spot_smaller$album_release_date, \"2016\")\n\n[1] │ &lt;2016&gt;-01-01\n[3] │ &lt;2016&gt;-04-23\n\nstr_view(spot_smaller$title, \"M\")\n\n [1] │ Hear &lt;M&gt;e Now\n [5] │ &lt;M&gt;y Oh &lt;M&gt;y (feat.

Compare the output from str_view() and str_subset() here. Both of these functions can be hard to work with in a tibble.\n\nstr_view(spot_smaller$title, \"M\")\n\n [1] │ Hear &lt;M&gt;e Now\n [5] │ &lt;M&gt;y Oh &lt;M&gt;y (feat.

Recall how that plot was very suspicious? The population density data that came with the state geometries from our source seemed incorrect.\nLet’s see if we can use our new web scraping skills to scrape the correct population density data and repeat that plot! Can we go out and find the real statewise population densities, create a tidy data frame, merge that with our state geometry shapefiles, and then regenerate our plot?\nA quick wikipedia search yields this webpage with more reasonable population densities in a nice table format. Let’s see if we can grab this data using our 4 steps to rvesting data!\n\n# check that scraping is allowed (Step

Thus, we have to be very careful when we join the state vaccine info to the state geography data.\nRun this line by line to see what it does:\n\nvacc_mar13 &lt;- vacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  mutate(State = str_to_lower(State))\n\nvacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\")) |&gt;\n  rename(region = State) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,\n                          group = group)) + \n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = people_vaccinated_per100), color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noops, New York appears to be a problem.\n\nvacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  anti_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\"))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  State          Date       people_vaccinated_per100 share_doses_used Governor\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;date&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 alaska         2021-03-13                     27.0            0.686 R       \n2 hawaii         2021-03-13                     22.8            0.759 D       \n3 new york state 2021-03-13                     21.7            0.764 D       \n\nus_states |&gt;\n  anti_join(vacc_mar13, by = c(\"region\" = \"State\")) |&gt;\n  count(region)\n\n                region   n\n1 district of columbia  10\n2             new york 495\n\n\n[Pause to ponder:] What did we learn by running anti_join() above?\nNotice that the us_states map also includes only the contiguous 48 states.

It’s impossible to preserve both shape and area when projecting an (imperfect) sphere onto a flat surface, so that’s why you sometimes see such different maps of the world. This is why packages like maps which connect latitude-longitude points are being phased out in favor of packages like sf with more GIS functionality. We won’t get too deep into GIS in this class, but to learn more, take Spatial Data Analysis!!\n\n\nMultiple maps!\nYou can still use data viz tools from Data Science 1 (like facetting) to create things like time trends in maps:\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\nweekly_vacc &lt;- vaccines |&gt;\n  mutate(State = str_to_lower(State)) |&gt;\n  mutate(State = str_replace(State, \" state\", \"\"),\n         week = week(Date)) |&gt;\n  group_by(week, State) |&gt;\n  summarize(date = first(Date),\n            mean_daily_vacc = mean(daily_vaccinated/est_population*1000)) |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by =c(\"State\" = \"region\")) |&gt;\n  rename(region = State)\n\nweekly_vacc |&gt;\n  filter(week &gt; 2, week &lt; 11) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,\n                          group = group)) + \n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = mean_daily_vacc), color = \"darkgrey\", \n               linewidth = 0.1) + \n  labs(fill = \"Weekly Average Daily Vaccinations per 1000\") +\n  coord_map() + \n  theme_void() + \n  scale_fill_viridis() + \n  facet_wrap(~date) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Pause to ponder:] are we bothered by the warning about many-to-many when you run the code above?\n\n\nOther cool state maps\n\nstatebin (square representation of states)\n\nlibrary(statebins) # may need to install\n\nvacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  mutate(State = str_to_title(State)) |&gt;\n  statebins(state_col = \"State\",\n            value_col = \"people_vaccinated_per100\") + \n1  theme_statebins() +\n  labs(fill = \"People Vaccinated per 100\")\n\n\n1\n\nOne nice layout. You can customize with usual ggplot themes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Pause to ponder:] Why might one use a map like above instead of our previous choropleth maps?\nI used this example to create the code above. The original graph is located here.\n\n\n\nInteractive point maps with leaflet\nTo add even more power and value to your plots, we can add interactivity. For now, we will use the leaflet package, but later in the course we will learn even more powerful and flexible approaches for creating interactive plots and webpages.\nFor instance, here is a really simple plot with a pop-up window:\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\nleaflet() |&gt; \n1  addTiles() |&gt;\n2  setView(-93.1832, 44.4597, zoom = 17) |&gt;\n3  addPopups(-93.1832, 44.4597, 'Here is the &lt;b&gt;Regents Hall of Mathematical Sciences&lt;/b&gt;, home of the Statistics and Data Science program at St. Olaf College')\n\n\n1\n\naddTiles() uses OpenStreetMap, an awesome open-source mapping resource, as the default tile layer (background map)\n\n2\n\nsetView() centers the map at a specific latitude and longitude, then zoom controls how much of the surrounding area is shown\n\n3\n\nadd a popup message (with html formatting) that can be clicked on or off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaflet is not part of the tidyverse, but the structure of its code is pretty similar and it also plays well with piping.\nLet’s try pop-up messages with a data set containing Airbnb listings in the Boston area:\n\nleaflet() |&gt;\n    addTiles() |&gt;\n    setView(lng = mean(airbnb.df$Long), lat = mean(airbnb.df$Lat), \n            zoom = 13) |&gt; \n    addCircleMarkers(data = airbnb.df,\n        lat = ~ Lat, \n        lng = ~ Long, \n        popup = ~ AboutListing, \n        radius = ~ S_Accomodates,  \n        # These last options describe how the circles look\n        weight = 2,\n        color = \"red\", \n        fillColor = \"yellow\")\n\n\n\n\n\n[Pause to ponder:] List similarities and differences between leaflet plots and ggplots.\n\n\nInteractive choropleth maps with leaflet\nOK. Now let’s see if we can put things together and duplicate the interactive choropleth map found here showing population density by state in the US.\n\nA preview to shapefiles and the sf package\n\n1library(sf)\n2states &lt;- read_sf(\"https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/json/us-states.geojson\")\n3class(states)\nstates\n\n\n1\n\nsf stands for “simple features”\n\n2\n\nFrom https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/us-states.js\n\n3\n\nNote that states has class sf in addition to the usual tbl and df\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\nSimple feature collection with 52 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -188.9049 ymin: 17.92956 xmax: -65.6268 ymax: 71.35163\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n# A tibble: 52 × 4\n   id    name                  density                                  geometry\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;                        &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [°]&gt;\n 1 01    Alabama                 94.6  (((-87.3593 35.00118, -85.60667 34.98475…\n 2 02    Alaska                   1.26 (((-131.602 55.11798, -131.5692 55.28229…\n 3 04    Arizona                 57.0  (((-109.0425 37.00026, -109.048 31.33163…\n 4 05    Arkansas                56.4  (((-94.47384 36.50186, -90.15254 36.4963…\n 5 06    California             242.

In the example we’re emulating, they use the read_sf() function from the sf package to read in data. While our us_states data frame from the maps package contained 15537 rows, our simple features object states contains only 52 rows - one per state. Importantly, states contains a column called geometry, which is a “multipolygon” with all the information necessary to draw a specific state. Also, while states can be treated as a tibble or data frame, it is also an sf class object with a specific “geodetic coordinate reference system”. Again, take Spatial Data Analysis for more on shapefiles and simple features!\nNote also that the authors of this example have already merged state population densities with state geometries, but if we wanted to merge in other state characteristics using the name column as a key, we could definitely do this!\nFirst we’ll start with a static plot using a simple features object and geom_sf():\n\n# Create density bins as on the webpage\nstate_plotting_sf &lt;- states |&gt;\n  mutate(density_intervals = cut(density, n = 8,\n          breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, Inf))) |&gt;\n  filter(!(name %in% c(\"Alaska\", \"Hawaii\", \"Puerto Rico\")))\n\nggplot(data = state_plotting_sf) + \n  geom_sf(aes(fill = density_intervals), colour = \"white\", linetype = 2) + \n#  geom_sf_label(aes(label = density)) +   # labels too busy here\n  theme_void() +  \n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlOrRd\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s use leaflet to create an interactive plot!\n\n# Create our own category bins for population densities\n#   and assign the yellow-orange-red color palette\nbins &lt;- c(0, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, Inf)\npal &lt;- colorBin(\"YlOrRd\", domain = states$density, bins = bins)\n\n# Create labels that pop up when we hover over a state.

See here for more detail.\nYour task is to create a two meaningful choropleth plots, one using a numeric variable and one using a categorical variable from poliscidata::states. You should make two versions of each plot: a static plot using the maps package and ggplot(), and an interactive plot using the sf package and leaflet().

You can then click on vacc_Mar21.csv to see the data we want to download. This link should also get you there, but it’s good to be able to navigate there yourself.\n\n# Approach 1\n1vaccine_data &lt;- read_csv(\"Data/vaccinations_2021.csv\")\n\n# Approach 2\n2vaccine_data &lt;- read_csv(\"~/264_fall_2024/Data/vaccinations_2021.csv\")\n\n# Approach 3\n3vaccine_data &lt;- read_csv(\"https://proback.github.io/264_fall_2024/Data/vaccinations_2021.csv\")\n\n# Approach 4\n4vaccine_data &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/proback/264_fall_2024/main/Data/vaccinations_2021.csv\")\n\n\n1\n\nApproach 1: create a Data folder in the same location where this .qmd file resides, and then store vaccinations_2021.csv in that Data folder\n\n2\n\nApproach 2: give R the complete path to the location of vaccinations_2021.csv, starting with Home (~)\n\n3\n\nApproach 3: link to our course webpage, and then know we have a Data folder containing all our csvs\n\n4\n\nApproach 4: navigate to the data in GitHub, hit the Raw button, and copy that link\n\n\n\n\nA recent Stat 272 project examined determinants of covid vaccination rates at the county level. Our data set contains 3053 rows (1 for each county in the US) and 14 columns; here is a quick description of the variables we’ll be using:\n\nstate = state the county is located in\ncounty = name of the county\nregion = region the state is located in\nmetro_status = Is the county considered “Metro” or “Non-metro”?\nrural_urban_code = from 1 (most urban) to 9 (most rural)\nperc_complete_vac = percent of county completely vaccinated as of 11/9/21\ntot_pop = total population in the county\nvotes_Trump = number of votes for Trump in the county in 2020\nvotes_Biden = number of votes for Biden in the county in 2020\nperc_Biden = percent of votes for Biden in the county in 2020\ned_somecol_perc = percent with some education beyond high school (but not a Bachelor’s degree)\ned_bachormore_perc = percent with a Bachelor’s degree or more\nunemployment_rate_2020 = county unemployment rate in 2020\nmedian_HHincome_2019 = county’s median household income in 2019\n\n\nConsider only Minnesota and its surrounding states (Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota). We want to examine the relationship between the percentage who voted for Biden and the percentage of complete vaccinations by state. Generate two plots to examine this relationship:\n\n\nA scatterplot with points and smoothers colored by state. Make sure the legend is ordered in a meaningful way, and include good labels on your axes and your legend. Also leave off the error bars from your smoothers.\nOne plot per state containing a scatterplot and a smoother.\n\nDescribe which plot you prefer and why. What can you learn from your preferred plot?\n\nWe wish to compare the proportions of counties in each region with median household income above the national median ($69,560).\n\n\nFill in the blanks below to produce a segmented bar plot with regions ordered from highest proportion above the median to lowest.\nCreate a table of proportions by region to illustrate that your bar plot in (a) is in the correct order (you should find two regions that are really close when you just try to eyeball differences).\nExplain why we can replace fct_relevel(region, FILL IN CODE) with\n\nmutate(region_sort = fct_reorder(region, median_HHincome_2019 &lt; 69560, .fun = mean))\nbut not\nmutate(region_sort = fct_reorder(region, median_HHincome_2019 &lt; 69560))\n\nvaccine_data |&gt;\n  mutate(HHincome_vs_national = ifelse(median_HHincome_2019 &lt; 69560, FILL IN CODE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(region_sort = fct_relevel(region, FILL IN CODE)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = region_sort, fill = HHincome_vs_national)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\nWe want to examine the distribution of total county populations and then see how it’s related to vaccination rates.\n\n\nCarefully and thoroughly explain why the two histograms below provide different plots.\n\n\nvaccine_data |&gt;\n  mutate(tot_pop_millions = tot_pop / 1000000) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = tot_pop_millions)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 40) +\n    labs(x = \"Total population in millions\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvaccine_data |&gt;\n  mutate(tot_pop_millions = tot_pop %/% 1000000) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = tot_pop_millions)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 40) +\n    labs(x = \"Total population in millions\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the top 5 counties in terms of total population.\nPlot a histogram of logged population and describe this distribution.\nPlot the relationship between log population and percent vaccinated using separate colors for Metro and Non-metro counties (be sure there’s no 3rd color used for NAs). Reduce the size and transparency of each point to make the plot more readable. Describe what you can learn from this plot.\n\n\nProduce 3 different plots for illustrating the relationship between the rural_urban_code and percent vaccinated. Hint: you can sometimes turn numeric variables into categorical variables for plotting purposes (e.g. as.factor(), ifelse()).\n\nState your favorite plot, why you like it better than the other two, and what you can learn from your favorite plot. Create an alt text description of your favorite plot, using the Four Ingredient Model. See this link for reminders and references about alt text.\n\nBEFORE running the code below, sketch the plot that will be produced by R. AFTER running the code, describe what conclusion(s) can we draw from this plot?\n\n\nvaccine_data |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(perc_Biden)) |&gt;\n  mutate(big_states = fct_lump(state, n = 10)) |&gt;\n  group_by(big_states) |&gt;\n  summarize(IQR_Biden = IQR(perc_Biden)) |&gt;\n  mutate(big_states = fct_reorder(big_states, IQR_Biden)) |&gt;\n  ggplot() + \n    geom_point(aes(x = IQR_Biden, y = big_states))\n\n\nIn this question we will focus only on the 12 states in the Midwest (i.e. where region == “Midwest”).\n\n\nCreate a tibble with the following information for each state. Order states from least to greatest state population.\n\n\nnumber of different rural_urban_codes represented among the state’s counties (there are 9 possible)\ntotal state population\nproportion of Metro counties\nmedian unemployment rate\n\n\nUse your tibble in (a) to produce a plot of the relationship between proportion of Metro counties and median unemployment rate. Points should be colored by the number of different rural_urban_codes in a state, but a single linear trend should be fit to all points. What can you conclude from the plot?\n\n\nGenerate an appropriate plot to compare vaccination rates between two subregions of the US: New England (which contains the states Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island) and the Upper Midwest (which, according to the USGS, contains the states Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa). What can you conclude from your plot?\n\nIn this next section, we consider a few variables that could have been included in our data set, but were NOT. Thus, you won’t be able to write and test code, but you nevertheless should be able to use your knowledge of the tidyverse to answer these questions.\nHere are the hypothetical variables:\n\nHR_party = party of that county’s US Representative (Republican, Democrat, Independent, Green, or Libertarian)\npeople_per_MD = number of residents per doctor (higher values = fewer doctors)\nperc_over_65 = percent of residents over 65 years old\nperc_white = percent of residents who identify as white\n\n\nHypothetical R chunk #1:\n\n\n# Hypothetical R chunk 1\ntemp &lt;- vaccine_data |&gt;\n  mutate(new_perc_vac = ifelse(perc_complete_vac &gt; 95, NA, perc_complete_vac),\n         MD_group = cut_number(people_per_MD, 3)) |&gt;\n  group_by(MD_group) |&gt;\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            mean_perc_vac = mean(new_perc_vac, na.rm = TRUE),\n            mean_white = mean(perc_white, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nDescribe the tibble temp created above.

Then, if we look at the first line above, we see we have one value we’re using over and over: df$a. So our function will have one input. We’ll start with our code from that line, then replace the input (df$a) with x. We should give our function a name that explains what it does. The name should be a verb.\n\n# I'm going to show you how to write the function in class! \n# I have it in the code already below, but don't look yet!\n# Let's try to write it together first!\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n\n# Our function (first draft!)\nrescale01 &lt;- function(x) {\n  (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))\n}\n\nNote the general form of a function:\n\nname &lt;- function(arguments) {\n  body\n}\n\nEvery function contains 3 essential components:\n\nA name. The name should clearly evoke what the function does; hence, it is often a verb (action). Here we’ll use rescale01 because this function rescales a vector to lie between 0 and 1. snake_case is good; CamelCase is just okay.\nThe arguments. The arguments are things that vary across calls and they are usually nouns - first the data, then other details. Our analysis above tells us that we have just one; we’ll call it x because this is the conventional name for a numeric vector, but you can use any word.\nThe body. The body is the code that’s repeated across all the calls. By default a function will return the last statement; use return() to specify a return value\n\nSummary: Functions should be written for both humans and computers!\nOnce we have written a function we like, then we need to test it with different inputs!\n\ntemp &lt;- c(4, 6, 8, 9)\nrescale01(temp)\n\n[1] 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.0\n\ntemp0 &lt;- c(4, 6, 8, 9, NA)\nrescale01(temp0)\n\n[1] NA NA NA NA NA\n\n\nOK, so NA’s don’t work the way we want them to.\n\nrescale01 &lt;- function(x) {\n  (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / (max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE))\n}\nrescale01(temp)\n\n[1] 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.0\n\nrescale01(temp0)\n\n[1] 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.0  NA\n\n\nWe can continue to improve our function. Here is another method, which uses the existing range function within R to avoid 3 max/min executions:\n\nrescale01 &lt;- function(x) {\n  rng &lt;- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])\n}\nrescale01(temp)\n\n[1] 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.0\n\nrescale01(c(0, 5, 10))\n\n[1] 0.0 0.5 1.0\n\nrescale01(c(-10, 0, 10))\n\n[1] 0.0 0.5 1.0\n\nrescale01(c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5))\n\n[1] 0.00 0.25 0.50   NA 1.00\n\n\nWe should continue testing unusual inputs. Think carefully about how you want this function to behave… the current behavior is to include the Inf (infinity) value when calculating the range. You get strange output everywhere, but it’s pretty clear that there is a problem right away when you use the function. In the example below (rescale1), you ignore the infinity value when calculating the range. The function returns Inf for one value, and sensible stuff for the rest. In many cases this may be useful, but it could also hide a problem until you get deeper into an analysis.\n\nx &lt;- c(1:10, Inf)\nrescale01(x)\n\n [1]   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0 NaN\n\nrescale1 &lt;- function(x) {\n  rng &lt;- range(x, na.rm = TRUE, finite = TRUE)\n  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])\n}\nrescale1(x)\n\n [1] 0.0000000 0.1111111 0.2222222 0.3333333 0.4444444 0.5555556 0.6666667\n [8] 0.7777778 0.8888889 1.0000000       Inf\n\n\nNow we’ve used functions to simplify original example. We will learn to simplify further in iterations (Ch 26)\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(\n  a = rnorm(10),\n  b = rnorm(10),\n  c = rnorm(10),\n  d = rnorm(10)\n)\n# add a little noise\ndf$a[5] = NA\ndf$b[6] = Inf\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n        a       b       c       d\n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1.39   -1.25   0.284   0.0396\n 2  0.851  -0.489  0.517   0.532 \n 3 -0.664  -1.53  -1.65   -0.293 \n 4  0.130   0.567  0.937  -1.43  \n 5 NA      -1.04   0.106   1.33  \n 6  1.86  Inf      1.40   -1.53  \n 7 -2.04    0.158  1.25   -0.210 \n 8  0.386   0.663  0.0393  0.124 \n 9  1.89   -0.363 -1.53   -1.01  \n10  0.101   1.22  -0.500  -0.172 \n\ndf$a_new &lt;- rescale1(df$a)\ndf$b_new &lt;- rescale1(df$b)\ndf$c_new &lt;- rescale1(df$c)\ndf$d_new &lt;- rescale1(df$d)\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 8\n        a       b       c       d  a_new   b_new  c_new  d_new\n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1.39   -1.25   0.284   0.0396  0.874   0.103 0.634  0.549 \n 2  0.851  -0.489  0.517   0.532   0.736   0.379 0.710  0.721 \n 3 -0.664  -1.53  -1.65   -0.293   0.350   0     0      0.432 \n 4  0.130   0.567  0.937  -1.43    0.552   0.763 0.848  0.0336\n 5 NA      -1.04   0.106   1.33   NA       0.179 0.576  1     \n 6  1.86  Inf      1.40   -1.53    0.993 Inf     1      0     \n 7 -2.04    0.158  1.25   -0.210   0       0.614 0.949  0.461 \n 8  0.386   0.663  0.0393  0.124   0.618   0.798 0.554  0.578 \n 9  1.89   -0.363 -1.53   -1.01    1       0.425 0.0388 0.180 \n10  0.101   1.22  -0.500  -0.172   0.545   1     0.377  0.475 \n\ndf |&gt;\n  select(1:4) |&gt;\n  mutate(a_new = rescale1(a),\n         b_new = rescale1(b),\n         c_new = rescale1(c),\n         d_new = rescale1(d))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 8\n        a       b       c       d  a_new   b_new  c_new  d_new\n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1.39   -1.25   0.284   0.0396  0.874   0.103 0.634  0.549 \n 2  0.851  -0.489  0.517   0.532   0.736   0.379 0.710  0.721 \n 3 -0.664  -1.53  -1.65   -0.293   0.350   0     0      0.432 \n 4  0.130   0.567  0.937  -1.43    0.552   0.763 0.848  0.0336\n 5 NA      -1.04   0.106   1.33   NA       0.179 0.576  1     \n 6  1.86  Inf      1.40   -1.53    0.993 Inf     1      0     \n 7 -2.04    0.158  1.25   -0.210   0       0.614 0.949  0.461 \n 8  0.386   0.663  0.0393  0.124   0.618   0.798 0.554  0.578 \n 9  1.89   -0.363 -1.53   -1.01    1       0.425 0.0388 0.180 \n10  0.101   1.22  -0.500  -0.172   0.545   1     0.377  0.475 \n\n# Even better - from Chapter 26\ndf |&gt; \n  select(1:4) |&gt;\n  mutate(across(a:d, rescale1, .names = \"{.col}_new\"))\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 8\n        a       b       c       d  a_new   b_new  c_new  d_new\n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1.39   -1.25   0.284   0.0396  0.874   0.103 0.634  0.549 \n 2  0.851  -0.489  0.517   0.532   0.736   0.379 0.710  0.721 \n 3 -0.664  -1.53  -1.65   -0.293   0.350   0     0      0.432 \n 4  0.130   0.567  0.937  -1.43    0.552   0.763 0.848  0.0336\n 5 NA      -1.04   0.106   1.33   NA       0.179 0.576  1     \n 6  1.86  Inf      1.40   -1.53    0.993 Inf     1      0     \n 7 -2.04    0.158  1.25   -0.210   0       0.614 0.949  0.461 \n 8  0.386   0.663  0.0393  0.124   0.618   0.798 0.554  0.578 \n 9  1.89   -0.363 -1.53   -1.01    1       0.425 0.0388 0.180 \n10  0.101   1.22  -0.500  -0.172   0.545   1     0.377  0.475 \n\n\n\n\nOptions for handling NAs in functions\nBefore we try some practice problems, let’s consider various options for handling NAs in functions. We used the na.rm option within functions like min, max, and range in order to take care of missing values. But there are alternative approaches:\n\nfilter/remove the NA values before rescaling\ncreate an if statement to check if there are NAs; return an error if NAs exist\ncreate a removeNAs option in the function we are creating\n\nLet’s take a look at each alternative approach in turn:\n\nFilter/remove the NA values before rescaling\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(\n  a = rnorm(10),\n  b = rnorm(10),\n  c = rnorm(10),\n  d = rnorm(10)\n)\ndf$a[5] = NA\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n         a       b      c       d\n     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  0.0190 -1.93   -0.150  0.841 \n 2  1.17   -0.0121 -0.314  0.517 \n 3  1.18   -1.03   -0.508 -0.437 \n 4  1.48    0.273  -0.148 -0.159 \n 5 NA      -0.863   1.16  -0.364 \n 6 -0.732   0.172  -0.899 -2.45  \n 7  0.0444  1.04   -0.242  1.17  \n 8  1.05   -0.508  -1.06  -0.0939\n 9  0.865  -0.161   0.255 -0.505 \n10 -0.549  -0.473   0.674  0.579 \n\nrescale_basic &lt;- function(x) {\n  (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))\n}\n\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(a)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(new_a = rescale_basic(a))\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 5\n        a       b      c       d  new_a\n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  0.0190 -1.93   -0.150  0.841  0.339 \n2  1.17   -0.0121 -0.314  0.517  0.858 \n3  1.18   -1.03   -0.508 -0.437  0.862 \n4  1.48    0.273  -0.148 -0.159  1     \n5 -0.732   0.172  -0.899 -2.45   0     \n6  0.0444  1.04   -0.242  1.17   0.350 \n7  1.05   -0.508  -1.06  -0.0939 0.802 \n8  0.865  -0.161   0.255 -0.505  0.720 \n9 -0.549  -0.473   0.674  0.579  0.0825\n\n\n[Pause to Ponder:] Do you notice anything in the output above that gives you pause?\n\n\nCreate an if statement to check if there are NAs; return an error if NAs exist\nFirst, here’s an example involving weighted means:\n\n# Create function to calculate weighted mean\nwt_mean &lt;- function(x, w) {\n  sum(x * w) / sum(w)\n}\nwt_mean(c(1, 10), c(1/3, 2/3))\n\n[1] 7\n\nwt_mean(1:6, 1:3)\n\n[1] 7.666667\n\n\n[Pause to Ponder:] Why is the answer to the last call above 7.67?

    "text": "Data frame functions\nThese work like dplyr verbs, taking a data frame as the first argument, and then returning a data frame or a vector.\n\nDemonstration of tidy evaluation in functions\n\n# Start with working code then functionize\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.75) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmake_plot &lt;- function(dataset, xvar, yvar, pt_size = 0.75)  {\n  ggplot(data = dataset, mapping = aes(x = xvar, y = yvar)) +\n    geom_point(size = pt_size) +\n    geom_smooth()\n}\n\nmake_plot(dataset = mpg, xvar = cty, yvar = hwy)  # Error!\n\nError in `geom_point()`:\n! Problem while computing aesthetics.\nℹ Error occurred in the 1st layer.\nCaused by error:\n! object 'cty' not found\n\n\nThe problem is tidy evaluation, which makes most common coding easier, but makes some less common things harder. Key terms to understand tidy evaluation:\n\nenv-variables = live in the environment (mpg)\ndata-variables = live in data frame or tibble (cty)\ndata masking = tidyverse use data-variables as if they are env-variables. That is, you don’t always need mpg$cty to access cty in tidyverse\n\nThe key idea behind data masking is that it blurs the line between the two different meanings of the word “variable”:\n\nenv-variables are “programming” variables that live in an environment. They are usually created with &lt;-.\ndata-variables are “statistical” variables that live in a data frame. They usually come from data files (e.g. .csv, .xls), or are created manipulating existing variables.\n\nThe solution is to embrace {{ }} data-variables which are user inputs into functions. One way to remember what’s happening, as suggested by our book authors, is to think of {{ }} as looking down a tunnel — {{ var }} will make a dplyr function look inside of var rather than looking for a variable called var. Thus, embracing a variable tells dplyr to use the value stored inside the argument, not the argument as the literal variable name.\nSee Section 25.3 of R4DS for more details (and there are plenty!).\n\n# This will work to make our plot!\nmake_plot &lt;- function(dataset, xvar, yvar, pt_size = 0.75)  {\n  ggplot(data = dataset, mapping = aes(x = {{ xvar }}, y = {{ yvar }})) +\n    geom_point(size = pt_size) +\n    geom_smooth()\n}\n\nmake_plot(dataset = mpg, xvar = cty, yvar = hwy)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI often wish it were easier to get my own custom summary statistics for numeric variables in EDA rather than using mosaic::favstats(). Using group_by() and summarise() from the tidyverse reads clearly but takes so many lines, but if I only had to write the code once…\n\nsummary6 &lt;- function(data, var) {\n  data |&gt; summarize(\n    mean = mean({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE),\n    median = median({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE),\n    sd = sd({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE),\n    IQR = IQR({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n(),\n    n_miss = sum(is.na({{ var }})),\n    .groups = \"drop\"    # to leave the data in an ungrouped state\n  )\n}\n\nmpg |&gt; summary6(hwy)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n   mean median    sd   IQR     n n_miss\n  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n1  23.4     24  5.95     9   234      0\n\n\nEven cooler, I can use my new function with group_by()!\n\nmpg |&gt; \n  group_by(drv) |&gt;\n  summary6(hwy)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 7\n  drv    mean median    sd   IQR     n n_miss\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n1 4      19.2     18  4.08     5   103      0\n2 f      28.2     28  4.21     3   106      0\n3 r      21       21  3.66     7    25      0\n\n\nYou can even pass conditions into a function using the embrace:\n[Pause to Ponder:] Predict what the code below will do, and (only) then run it to check. Think about: why do we have sort = sort? why not embrace df? why didn’t we need n in the arguments?\n\nnew_function &lt;- function(df, var, condition, sort = TRUE) {\n  df |&gt;\n    filter({{ condition }}) |&gt;\n    count({{ var }}, sort = sort) |&gt;\n    mutate(prop = n / sum(n))\n}\n\nmpg |&gt; new_function(var = manufacturer, \n                    condition = manufacturer %in% c(\"audi\", \n                                                    \"honda\", \n                                                    \"hyundai\", \n                                                    \"nissan\", \n                                                    \"subaru\", \n                                                    \"toyota\", \n                                                    \"volkswagen\")\n                    )\n\n\n\nData-masking vs. tidy-selection (Section 25.3.4)\nWhy doesn’t the following code work?\n\ncount_missing &lt;- function(df, group_vars, x_var) {\n  df |&gt; \n    group_by({{ group_vars }}) |&gt; \n    summarize(\n      n_miss = sum(is.na({{ x_var }})),\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n}\n\nflights |&gt; \n  count_missing(c(year, month, day), dep_time)\n\nError in `group_by()`:\nℹ In argument: `c(year, month, day)`.\nCaused by error:\n! `c(year, month, day)` must be size 336776 or 1, not 1010328.\n\n\nThe problem is that group_by() uses data-masking rather than tidy-selection; it is selecting certain variables rather than evaluating values of those variables. These are the two most common subtypes of tidy evaluation:\n\nData-masking is used in functions like arrange(), filter(), mutate(), and summarize() that compute with variables. Data masking is an R feature that blends programming variables that live inside environments (env-variables) with statistical variables stored in data frames (data-variables).\n\nTidy-selection is used for functions like select(), relocate(), and rename() that select variables. Tidy selection provides a concise dialect of R for selecting variables based on their names or properties.\n\nMore detail can be found here.\nThe error above can be solved by using the pick() function, which uses tidy selection inside of data masking:\n\ncount_missing &lt;- function(df, group_vars, x_var) {\n  df |&gt; \n    group_by(pick({{ group_vars }})) |&gt; \n    summarize(\n      n_miss = sum(is.na({{ x_var }})),\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n}\n\nflights |&gt; \n  count_missing(c(year, month, day), dep_time)\n\n# A tibble: 365 × 4\n    year month   day n_miss\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n 1  2013     1     1      4\n 2  2013     1     2      8\n 3  2013     1     3     10\n 4  2013     1     4      6\n 5  2013     1     5      3\n 6  2013     1     6      1\n 7  2013     1     7      3\n 8  2013     1     8      4\n 9  2013     1     9      5\n10  2013     1    10      3\n# ℹ 355 more rows\n\n\n[Pause to Ponder:] Here’s another nice use of pick().

This is a bit more complicated, but still do-able!\nFor this, we’ll need the rlang package. rlang is a low-level package that’s used by just about every other package in the tidyverse because it implements tidy evaluation (as well as many other useful tools).\nCheck out the following update of our histogram() function which uses the englue() function from the rlang package:\n\nhistogram &lt;- function(df, var, bins) {\n  label &lt;- rlang::englue(\"A histogram of {{var}} with binwidth {bins}\")\n  \n  df |&gt; \n    ggplot(aes(x = {{ var }})) + \n    geom_histogram(bins = bins) + \n    labs(title = label)\n}\n\nflights |&gt; histogram(air_time, 35)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Your Own\n\nRewrite this code snippet as a function: x / sum(x, na.rm = TRUE). This code creates weights which sum to 1, where NA values are ignored. Test it for at least two different vectors. (Make sure at least one has NAs!)\nCreate a function to calculate the standard error of a variable, where SE = square root of the variance divided by the sample size. Hint: start with a vector like x &lt;- 0:5 or x &lt;- gss_cat$age and write code to find the SE of x, then turn it into a function to handle any vector x. Note: var is the function to find variance in R and sqrt does square root. length may also be handy. Test your function on two vectors that do not include NAs (i.e. do not worry about removing NAs at this point).\nUse your se function within summarize to get a table of the mean and s.e. of hwy and cty by class in the mpg dataset.\nUse your se function within summarize to get a table of the mean and s.e. of arr_delay and dep_delay by carrier in the flights dataset. Why does the output look like this?\nMake your se function handle NAs with an na.rm option. Test your new function (you can call it se again) on a vector that doesn’t include NA and on the same vector with an added NA. Be sure to check that it gives the expected output with na.rm = TRUE and na.rm = FALSE. Make na.rm = FALSE the default value. Repeat #4. (Hint: be sure when you divide by sample size you don’t count any NAs)\nCreate both_na(), a function that takes two vectors of the same length and returns how many positions have an NA in both vectors. Hint: create two vectors like test_x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, NA, NA) and test_y &lt;- c(NA, 1, 2, 3, NA) and write code that works for test_x and test_y, then turn it into a function that can handle any x and y. (In this case, the answer would be 1, since both vectors have NA in the 5th position.) Test it for at least one more combination of x and y.\nRun your code from (6) with the following two vectors: test_x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, NA, NA, NA) and test_y &lt;- c(NA, 1, 2, 3, NA). Did you get the output you wanted or expected? Modify your function using if, else, and stop to print an error if x and y are not the same length. Then test again with test_x, test_y and the sets of vectors you used in (6).\nHere is a way to get not_cancelled flights in the flights dataset:\n\n\nnot_cancelled &lt;- flights %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))\n\nIs it necessary to check is.na for both departure and arrival? Using summarize, find the number of flights missing departure delay, arrival delay, and both. (Use your new function!)\n\nRead the code for each of the following three functions, puzzle out what they do, and then brainstorm better names.\n\n\nf1 &lt;- function(time1, time2) {\n  hour1 &lt;- time1 %/% 100\n  min1 &lt;- time1 %% 100\n  hour2 &lt;- time2 %/% 100\n  min2 &lt;- time2 %% 100\n  \n  (hour2 - hour1)*60 + (min2 - min1)\n}\n\n\nf2 &lt;- function(lengthcm, widthcm) {\n  (lengthcm / 2.54) * (widthcm / 2.54)\n}\n\n\nf3 &lt;- function(x) {\n  fct_collapse(x, \"non answer\" = c(\"No answer\", \"Refused\", \n                                   \"Don't know\", \"Not applicable\"))\n}\n\n\nExplain what the following function does and demonstrate by running foo1(x) with a few appropriately chosen vectors x. (Hint: set x and run the “guts” of the function piece by piece.)\n\n\nfoo1 &lt;- function(x) {\n  diff &lt;- x[-1] - x[1:(length(x) - 1)]\n  sum(diff &lt; 0)\n}\n\n\nThe foo1() function doesn’t perform well if a vector has missing values. Amend foo1() so that it produces a helpful error message and stops if there are any missing values in the input vector. Show that it works with appropriately chosen vectors x. Be sure you add error = TRUE to your R chunk, or else knitting will fail!\nWrite a function called greet using if, else if, and else to print out “good morning” if it’s before 12 PM, “good afternoon” if it’s between 12 PM and 5 PM, and “good evening” if it’s after 5 PM. Your function should work if you input a time like: greet(time = \"2018-05-03 17:38:01 CDT\") or if you input the current time with greet(time = Sys.time()). [Hint: check out the hour function in the lubridate package]\nModify the summary6() function from earlier to add an argument that gives the user an option to remove missing values, if any exist. Show that your function works for (a) the hwy variable in mpg_tbl &lt;- as_tibble(mpg), and (b) the age variable in gss_cat.\nAdd an argument to (13) to produce summary statistics by group for a second variable (you should now have 4 possible inputs to your function). Show that your function works for (a) the hwy variable in mpg_tbl &lt;- as_tibble(mpg) grouped by drv, and (b) the age variable in gss_cat grouped by partyid.\nCreate a function that has a vector as the input and returns the last value. (Note: Be sure to use a name that does not write over an existing function!)\nSave your final table from (14) and write a function to draw a scatterplot of a measure of center (mean or median - user can choose) vs. a measure of spread (sd or IQR - user can choose), with points sized by sample size, to see if there is constant variance. Each point should be labeled with partyid, and the plot title should reflect the variables chosen by the user.\n\nHint: start with a ggplot with no user input, and then functionize:\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nparty_age |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = mean, y = sd)) + \n    geom_point(aes(size = n)) +\n    geom_smooth(method = lm) +\n    geom_label_repel(aes(label = partyid)) +\n    labs(title = \"Mean vs SD\")",

We’ve already seen how functions (Ch 25) can help reduce duplication by extracting repeated patterns of code. Another tool is iteration, when you find you’re doing the same thing to multiple inputs – repeating the same operation on different columns or datasets.\nHere we’ll see two important iteration paradigms: imperative programming and functional programming.",

    "text": "Using iteration for simulation\nThis applet contains data from a 2005 study on the use of dolphin-facilitated therapy on the treatment of depression. In that study, 10 of the 15 subjects (67%) assigned to dolphin therapy showed improvement, compared to only 3 of the 15 subjects (20%) assigned to the control group. But with such small sample sizes, is this significant evidence that the dolphin group had greater improvement of their depressive symptoms? To answer that question, we can use simulation to conduct a randomization test.\nWe will simulate behavior in the “null world” where there is no real effect of treatment. In that case, the 13 total improvers would have improved no matter the treatment assigned, and the 17 total non-improvers would have not improved no matter the treatment assigned. So in the “null world”, treatment is a meaningless label that can be just as easily shuffled among subjects without any effect. In that world, the fact we observed a 47 percentage point difference in success rates (67 - 20) was just random luck. But we should ask: how often would we expect a difference as large as 47% by chance, assuming we’re living in the null world where there is no effect of treatment?\nYou could think about simulating this situation with the following steps:\n\nwrite code to calculate the difference in success rates in the observed data\nwrite a loop to calculate the differences in success rates from 1000 simulated data sets from the null world. Store those 1000 simulated differences\ncalculate how often we found a difference in the null world as large as that found in the observed data. In statistics, when this probability is below .05, we typically reject the null world, and conclude that there is likely a real difference between the two groups (i.e. a “statistically significant” difference)\n\n[Pause to Ponder:] Fill in Step 2 in the second R chunk below to carry out the three steps above.

For example:\n\nSearching for “R Reddit package” returns RedditExtractor\nSearching for “R Weather.com package” returns weatherData\n\nrOpenSci also has a good collection of wrapper packages.\n\nIn particular, tidycensus is a wrapper package that makes it easy to obtain desired census information for mapping and modeling:\n\n\nWarning: • You have not set a Census API key. Users without a key are limited to 500\nqueries per day and may experience performance limitations.\nℹ For best results, get a Census API key at\nhttp://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html and then

Be aware that most APIs do have rate limits — especially for their free tiers.\n\nNavigate to https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html to obtain a Census API key:\n\nOrganization: St. Olaf College\nEmail: Your St. Olaf email address\n\nYou will get the message:\n\nYour request for a new API key has been successfully submitted. Please check your email. In a few minutes you should receive a message with instructions on how to activate your new key.\n\nCheck your email. Copy and paste your key into a new text file:\n\nFile &gt; New File &gt; Text File (towards the bottom of the menu)\nSave as census_api_key.txt in the same folder as this .qmd.\n\nYou could then read in the key with code like this:\n\nmyapikey &lt;- readLines(\"~/264_fall_2024/DS2_preview_work/census_api_key.txt\")\n\n\n\nHandling API keys\nWhile this works, the problem is once we start backing up our files to GitHub, your API key will also appear on GitHub, and you want to keep your API key secret. Thus, we might use environment variables instead:\nOne way to store a secret across sessions is with environment variables. Environment variables, or envvars for short, are a cross platform way of passing information to processes. For passing envvars to R, you can list name-value pairs in a file called .Renviron in your home directory. The easiest way to edit it is to run:\n\nfile.edit(\"~/.Renviron\")\n\nThe file looks something like\nPATH = “path” VAR1 = “value1” VAR2 = “value2” And you can access the values in R using Sys.getenv():\n\nSys.getenv(\"VAR1\")\n#&gt; [1] \"value1\"\n\nNote that .Renviron is only processed on startup, so you’ll need to restart R to see changes.\nAnother option is to use Sys.setenv and Sys.getenv:\n\n# I used the first line to store my CENSUS API key in .Renviron\n#   after uncommenting - should only need to run one time\n# Sys.setenv(\"CENSUS_KEY\" = \"my census api key pasted here\")\n# my_census_api_key &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"CENSUS_KEY\")\n\n\n\nNavigating API documentation\nNavigate to the Census API user guide and click on the “Example API Queries” tab.\nLet’s look at the Population Estimates Example and the American Community Survey (ACS) Example. These examples walk us through the steps to incrementally build up a URL to obtain desired data. This URL is known as a web API request.\nhttps://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1?get=NAME,B02015_009E,B02015_009M&for=state:*\n\nhttps://api.census.gov: This is the base URL.\n\nhttp://: The scheme, which tells your browser or program how to communicate with the web server. This will typically be either http: or https:.\napi.census.gov: The hostname, which is a name that identifies the web server that will process the request.\n\ndata/2019/acs/acs1: The path, which tells the web server how to get to the desired resource.\n\nIn the case of the Census API, this locates a desired dataset in a particular year.\nOther APIs allow search functionality. (e.g., News organizations have article searches.) In these cases, the path locates the search function we would like to call.\n\n?get=NAME,B02015_009E,B02015_009M&for=state:*: The query parameters, which provide the parameters for the function you would like to call.\n\nWe can view this as a string of key-value pairs separated by &. That is, the general structure of this part is key1=value1&key2=value2.\n\n\n\n\n\nkey\nvalue\n\n\n\n\nget\nNAME,B02015_009E,B02015_009M\n\n\nfor\nstate:*\n\n\n\nTypically, each of these URL components will be specified in the API documentation. Sometimes, the scheme, hostname, and path (https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1) will be referred to as the endpoint for the API call.\nWe will first use the httr2 package to build up a full URL from its parts.\n\nrequest() creates an API request object using the base URL\nreq_url_path_append() builds up the URL by adding path components separated by /\nreq_url_query() adds the ? separating the endpoint from the query and sets the key-value pairs in the query\n\nThe .multi argument controls how multiple values for a given key are combined.\nThe I() function around \"state:*\" inhibits parsing of special characters like : and *. (It’s known as the “as-is” function.)\nThe backticks around for are needed because for is a reserved word in R (for for-loops). You’ll need backticks whenever the key name has special characters (like spaces, dashes).\nWe can see from here that providing an API key is achieved with key=YOUR_API_KEY.\n\n\n\n# Request total number of Hmong residents and margin of error by state\n#   in 2019, as in the User Guide\nCENSUS_API_KEY &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"CENSUS_API_KEY\")\nreq &lt;- request(\"https://api.census.gov\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"data\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"2019\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"acs\") |&gt; \n    req_url_path_append(\"acs1\") |&gt; \n    req_url_query(get = c(\"NAME\", \"B02015_009E\", \"B02015_009M\"), `for` = I(\"state:*\"), key = CENSUS_API_KEY, .multi = \"comma\")\n\nWhy would we ever use these steps instead of just using the full URL as a string?\n\nTo generalize this code with functions! (This is exactly what wrapper packages do.)\nTo handle special characters\n\ne.g., query parameters might have spaces, which need to be represented in a particular way in a URL (URLs can’t contain spaces)\n\n\nOnce we’ve fully constructed our request, we can use req_perform() to send out the API request and get a response.\n\nresp &lt;- req_perform(req)\nresp\n\nWe see from Content-Type that the format of the response is something called JSON. We can navigate to the request URL to see the structure of this output.\n\nJSON (Javascript Object Notation) is a nested structure of key-value pairs.\nWe can use resp_body_json() to parse the JSON into a nicer format.\n\nWithout simplifyVector = TRUE, the JSON is read in as a list.\n\n\n\nresp_json_list &lt;- resp |&gt; resp_body_json()\nhead(resp_json_list, 2)\n\n[[1]]\n[[1]][[1]]\n[1] \"NAME\"\n\n[[1]][[2]]\n[1] \"B02015_009E\"\n\n[[1]][[3]]\n[1] \"B02015_009M\"\n\n[[1]][[4]]\n[1] \"state\"\n\n\n[[2]]\n[[2]][[1]]\n[1] \"Illinois\"\n\n[[2]][[2]]\n[1] \"655\"\n\n[[2]][[3]]\n[1] \"511\"\n\n[[2]][[4]]\n[1] \"17\"\n\nresp_json_df &lt;- resp |&gt; resp_body_json(simplifyVector = TRUE)\nhead(resp_json_df)\n\n     [,1]       [,2]          [,3]          [,4]   \n[1,] \"NAME\"     \"B02015_009E\" \"B02015_009M\" \"state\"\n[2,] \"Illinois\" \"655\"         \"511\"         \"17\"   \n[3,] \"Georgia\"  \"3162\"        \"1336\"        \"13\"   \n[4,] \"Idaho\"    NA            NA            \"16\"   \n[5,] \"Hawaii\"   \"56\"          \"92\"          \"15\"   \n[6,] \"Indiana\"  \"1344\"        \"1198\"        \"18\"   \n\nresp_json_df &lt;- janitor::row_to_names(resp_json_df, 1)\nhead(resp_json_df)\n\n     NAME       B02015_009E B02015_009M state\n[1,] \"Illinois\" \"655\"       \"511\"       \"17\" \n[2,] \"Georgia\"  \"3162\"      \"1336\"      \"13\" \n[3,] \"Idaho\"    NA          NA          \"16\" \n[4,] \"Hawaii\"   \"56\"        \"92\"        \"15\" \n[5,] \"Indiana\"  \"1344\"      \"1198\"      \"18\" \n[6,] \"Iowa\"     \"685\"       \"705\"       \"19\" \n\n\nAll right, let’s try this!

We can see the core parts of HTML from the rvest vignette.\n\n\nFinding CSS Selectors\nIn order to gather information from a webpage, we must learn the language used to identify patterns of specific information. For example, on the NIH News Releases page, we can see that the data is represented in a consistent pattern of image + title + abstract.\nWe will identify data in a web page using a pattern matching language called CSS Selectors that can refer to specific patterns in HTML, the language used to write web pages.\nFor example:\n\nSelecting by tag:\n\n\"a\" selects all hyperlinks in a webpage (“a” represents “anchor” links in HTML)\n\"p\" selects all paragraph elements\n\nSelecting by ID and class:\n\n\".description\" selects all elements with class equal to “description”\n\nThe . at the beginning is what signifies class selection.\nThis is one of the most common CSS selectors for scraping because in HTML, the class attribute is extremely commonly used to format webpage elements. (Any number of HTML elements can have the same class, which is not true for the id attribute.)\n\n\"#mainTitle\" selects the SINGLE element with id equal to “mainTitle”\n\nThe # at the beginning is what signifies id selection.\n\n\n\n&lt;p class=\"title\"&gt;Title of resource 1&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"description\"&gt;Description of resource 1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\"title\"&gt;Title of resource 2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"description\"&gt;Description of resource 2&lt;/p&gt;\nWarning: Websites change often! So if you are going to scrape a lot of data, it is probably worthwhile to save and date a copy of the website. Otherwise, you may return after some time and your scraping code will include all of the wrong CSS selectors.\n\n\nSelectorGadget\nAlthough you can learn how to use CSS Selectors by hand, we will use a shortcut by installing the Selector Gadget tool.\n\nThere is a version available for Chrome–add it to Chrome via the Chome Web Store.\n\nMake sure to pin the extension to the menu bar. (Click the 3 dots &gt; Extensions &gt; Manage extensions. Click the “Details” button under SelectorGadget and toggle the “Pin to toolbar” option.)\n\nThere is also a version that can be saved as a bookmark in the browser–see here.\n\nYou might watch the Selector Gadget tutorial video.",

Click the Selector Gadget extension icon or bookmark button. As you mouse over the webpage, different parts will be highlighted in orange. Click on the title (but not the live link portion!) of the first news release. You’ll notice that the Selector Gadget information in the lower right describes what you clicked on. (If SelectorGadget ever highlights too much in green, you can click on portions that you do not want to turn them red.)\nScroll through the page to verify that only the information you intend (the description paragraph) is selected. The selector panel shows the CSS selector (.teaser-title) and the number of matches for that CSS selector (10). (You may have to be careful with your clicking–there are two overlapping boxes, and clicking on the link of the title can lead to the CSS selector of “a”.)\n[Pause to Ponder:] Repeat the process above to find the correct selectors for the following fields. Make sure that each matches 10 results:\n\nThe publication date\n\n\n.date-display-single\n\n\nThe article abstract paragraph (which will also include the publication date)\n\n\n.teaser-description\n\n\nRetrieving Data Using rvest and CSS Selectors\nNow that we have identified CSS selectors for the information we need, let’s fetch the data using the rvest package similarly to our approach in 08_table_scraping.qmd.\n\n# check that scraping is allowed (Step 0)\nrobotstxt::paths_allowed(\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases\")\n\n\n www.nih.gov                      \n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Step 1: Download the HTML and turn it into an XML file with read_html()\nnih &lt;- read_html(\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases\")\n\nFinding the exact node (e.g. “.teaser-title”) is the tricky part.

    "text": "Calculate tf-idf.\nThe tf-idf statistic is term frequency times inverse document frequency, a quantity used for identifying terms that are especially important to a particular document. The idea of tf-idf is to find the important words for the content of each document by decreasing the weight for commonly used words and increasing the weight for words that are not used very much in a collection or corpus of documents. We want to find words that define one document as opposed to others.\n\ntf = term frequency = proportion of times a term appears in a document.\n\nidf = inverse document frequency = log(number of documents / number of documents with the term), so that terms that appear in fewer documents are weighted higher, since those rarer words provide more information.\n\nThere’s really no theory behind multiplying the two together - it just tends to work in practice.

    "section": "Topic Modeling",
    "text": "Topic Modeling\nAs described in Ch 6 of Text Mining with R:\n\nIn text mining, we often have collections of documents, such as blog posts or news articles, that we’d like to divide into natural groups so that we can understand them separately. Topic modeling is a method for unsupervised classification of such documents, similar to clustering on numeric data, which finds natural groups of items even when we’re not sure what we’re looking for.\n\n\nLatent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a particularly popular method for fitting a topic model. It treats each document as a mixture of topics, and each topic as a mixture of words. This allows documents to “overlap” each other in terms of content, rather than being separated into discrete groups, in a way that mirrors typical use of natural language.\n\nWe will attempt to apply LDA to our collection of three works. While not a typical application of topic modeling, it’ll be interesting to see if any common themes or groupings emerge.\nAgain, from Ch 6:\n\nLatent Dirichlet allocation is one of the most common algorithms for topic modeling. Without diving into the math behind the model, we can understand it as being guided by two principles.\n\n\n\nEvery document is a mixture of topics. We imagine that each document may contain words from several topics in particular proportions. For example, in a two-topic model we could say “Document 1 is 90% topic A and 10% topic B, while Document 2 is 30% topic A and 70% topic B.”\n\n\n\n\nEvery topic is a mixture of words. For example, we could imagine a two-topic model of American news, with one topic for “politics” and one for “entertainment.” The most common words in the politics topic might be “President”, “Congress”, and “government”, while the entertainment topic may be made up of words such as “movies”, “television”, and “actor”. Importantly, words can be shared between topics; a word like “budget” might appear in both equally.\n\n\n\nLDA is a mathematical method for estimating both of these at the same time: finding the mixture of words that is associated with each topic, while also determining the mixture of topics that describes each document.\n\nIn order to implement LDA on our three books, we need to first “cast” our tidy data as a document-term matrix (DTM) where:\n\neach row represents one document (such as a book or article),\neach column represents one term, and\neach value (typically) contains the number of appearances of that term in that document.\n\nFrom Section 5.2 of Text Mining with R:\n\nSince most pairings of document and term do not occur (they have the value zero), DTMs are usually implemented as sparse matrices. These objects can be treated as though they were matrices (for example, accessing particular rows and columns), but are stored in a more efficient format.\n\n\nDTM objects cannot be used directly with tidy tools, just as tidy data frames cannot be used as input for most text mining packages. Thus, the tidytext package provides two verbs (tidy and cast) that convert between the two formats.\n\n\nA DTM is typically comparable to a tidy data frame after a count or a group_by/summarize that contains counts or another statistic for each combination of a term and document.\n\n\n# cast the collection of 3 works as a document-term matrix\nlibrary(tm)\n\nLoading required package: NLP\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'NLP'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\nthree_books_dtm &lt;- book_word_count |&gt;\n  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word,\n         !is.na(word)) |&gt;\n  cast_dtm(title, word, n)\n\n# set a seed so that the output of the model is predictable\nlibrary(topicmodels)\nthree_books_lda &lt;- LDA(three_books_dtm, k = 2, control = list(seed = 1234))\nthree_books_lda\n\nA LDA_VEM topic model with 2 topics.\n\n\nAfter fitting our LDA model, we will first focus on the beta variable, which is the probability of a word being generated by a specific topic. Then we’ll turn to the gamma variable, which are the per-document per-topic probabilities, or the proportion of words from a document generated by a specific topic.\n\nthree_books_topics &lt;- tidy(three_books_lda, matrix = \"beta\")\nthree_books_topics\n\n# A tibble: 25,968 × 3\n   topic term        beta\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1 time    3.58e- 3\n 2     2 time    8.03e- 3\n 3     1 van     1.26e-14\n 4     2 van     6.65e- 3\n 5     1 night   3.41e- 3\n 6     2 night   6.39e- 3\n 7     1 helsing 1.91e-14\n 8     2 helsing 6.20e- 3\n 9     1 dear    2.18e- 3\n10     2 dear    4.61e- 3\n# ℹ 25,958 more rows\n\n# Find the most common words within each topic\nthree_books_top_terms &lt;- three_books_topics |&gt;\n  group_by(topic) |&gt;\n  slice_max(beta, n = 10) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  arrange(topic, -beta)\n\nthree_books_top_terms |&gt;\n  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +\n    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n    facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = \"free\") +\n    scale_y_reordered()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# This would be much cooler with more documents and if we were able\n#   to anti_join to remove proper nouns\n\n# Find words with greatest difference between two topics, using log ratio\nbeta_wide &lt;- three_books_topics |&gt;\n  mutate(topic = paste0(\"topic\", topic)) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = topic, values_from = beta) |&gt; \n  filter(topic1 &gt; .001 | topic2 &gt; .001) |&gt;\n  mutate(log_ratio = log2(topic2 / topic1))\n\nbeta_wide\n\n# A tibble: 196 × 4\n   term      topic1  topic2 log_ratio\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 time    3.58e- 3 0.00803     1.17 \n 2 van     1.26e-14 0.00665    38.9  \n 3 night   3.41e- 3 0.00639     0.906\n 4 helsing 1.91e-14 0.00620    38.2  \n 5 dear    2.18e- 3 0.00461     1.08 \n 6 lucy    5.62e-14 0.00459    36.3  \n 7 day     2.99e- 3 0.00455     0.607\n 8 hand    1.98e- 3 0.00433     1.12 \n 9 mina    2.40e-14 0.00433    37.4  \n10 door    2.12e- 3 0.00412     0.956\n# ℹ 186 more rows\n\nbeta_wide |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(abs(log_ratio))) |&gt;\n  slice_max(abs(log_ratio), n = 20) |&gt;\n  mutate(term = reorder(term, log_ratio)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(log_ratio, term, fill = log_ratio &gt; 0)) +\n    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n    labs(x = \"Log ratio of Beta values\",\n         y = \"Words in three works\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# find the gamma variable for each document and topic\nthree_books_documents &lt;- tidy(three_books_lda, matrix = \"gamma\")\nthree_books_documents\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  document                                    topic      gamma\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                       &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Dracula                                         1 0.000158  \n2 The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde     1 1.00      \n3 Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus         1 1.00      \n4 Dracula                                         2 1.00      \n5 The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde     2 0.00000613\n6 Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus         2 0.00000190\n\n# Dracula = Topic 2; other two books = Topic 1!",

The words should be sized by their respective counts and colored based on whether their sentiment is positive or negative. (Feel free to be resourceful and creative to color words by a third variable!)\nMake a faceted bar chart to compare the positive/negative sentiment trajectory over the 7 Harry Potter books. You should have one bar per chapter (thus chapter becomes the index), and the bar should extend up from 0 if there are more positive than negative words in a chapter (according to the “bing” lexicon), and it will extend down from 0 if there are more negative than positive words.\nRepeat (5) using a faceted scatterplot to show the average sentiment score according to the “afinn” lexicon for each chapter.

Be sure to remove names, spells, and stop words before running your topic models. (a) Make a plot to illustrate words with greatest difference between two topics, using log ratio.

    "text": "On Your Own - Extended Example from MDSR\nRefer to Section 15.5 in MDSR, where they attempt to replicate some of FiveThirtyEight’s analyses. The MDSR authors provide a mix of SQL and R code to perform their analyses, but the code will not work if you simply cut-and-paste as-is into R. Your task is to convert the book code into something that actually runs, and then apply it to data from 2024. Very little of the code needs to be adjusted; it mostly needs to be repackaged.\nHints:\n\nuse dbGetQuery()\nnote that what they call carrier is just called Reporting_Airline in the flightdata table; you don’t have to merge in a carrier table, although it’s unfortunate that the Reporting_Airline codes are a bit cryptic\n\n\nBelow Figure 15.1, the MDSR authors first describe how to plot slowest and fastest airports. Instead of using target time, which has a complex definition, we will use arrival time, which oversimplifies the situation but gets us in the ballpark. Duplicate the equivalent of the table below for 2024 using the code in MDSR:\n\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 3\n   dest  avgDepartDelay avgArrivalDelay\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 ORD            14.3            13.1 \n 2 MDW            12.8             7.40\n 3 DEN            11.3             7.60\n 4 IAD            11.3             7.45\n 5 HOU            11.3             8.07\n 6 DFW            10.7             9.00\n 7 BWI            10.2             6.04\n 8 BNA             9.47            8.94\n 9 EWR             8.70            9.61\n10 IAH             8.41            6.75\n# 20 more rows\n\n\nFollowing the table above, the MDSR authors mimic one more FiveThirtyEight table which ranks carriers by time added vs. typical and time added vs. target. In this case, we will find average arrival delay after controlling for the routes flown. Again, duplicate the equivalent of the table below for 2024 using the code in MDSR:\n\n\n# A tibble: 14 × 5\n   carrier carrier_name                numRoutes numFlights wAvgDelay\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                           &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 VX      Virgin America                     72      57510   -2.69  \n 2 FL      AirTran Airways Corporation       170      79495   -1.55  \n 3 AS      Alaska Airlines Inc.              242     160257   -1.44  \n 4 US      US Airways Inc.                   378     414665   -1.31  \n 5 DL      Delta Air Lines Inc.              900     800375   -1.01  \n 6 UA      United Air Lines Inc.             621     493528   -0.982 \n 7 MQ      Envoy Air                         442     392701   -0.455 \n 8 AA      American Airlines Inc.            390     537697   -0.0340\n 9 HA      Hawaiian Airlines Inc.             56      74732    0.272 \n10 OO      SkyWest Airlines Inc.            1250     613030    0.358 \n11 B6      JetBlue Airways                   316     249693    0.767 \n12 EV      ExpressJet Airlines Inc.         1534     686021    0.845 \n13 WN      Southwest Airlines Co.           1284    1174633    1.13  \n14 F9      Frontier Airlines Inc.            326      85474    2.29",

    "text": "On Your Own - Noninvasive Auditory Diagnostic Tools\nYou will use SQL to query the Wideband Acoustic Immittance (WAI) Database hosted by Smith College. WAI measurements are being developed as noninvasive auditory diagnostic tools for people of all ages, and the WAI Database hosts WAI ear measurements that have been published in peer-review articles. The goal of the database is to “enable auditory researchers to share WAI measurements and combine analyses over multiple datasets.”\nYou have two primary goals:\n\nduplicate Figure 1 from a 2019 manuscript by Susan Voss. You will need to query the WAI Database to build a dataset which you can pipe into ggplot() to recreate Figure 1 as closely as possible.\nFind a study where subjects of different sex, race, ethnicity, or age groups were enrolled, and produce plots of frequency vs. mean absorption by group.\n\nYou should be using JOINs in both (1) and (2).\nHints:\n\nParse the caption from Figure 1 carefully to determine how mean absorbances are calculated: “Mean absorbances for the 12 studies within the WAI database as of July 1, 2019. Noted in the legend are the peer-reviewed publications associated with the datasets, the number of individual ears, and the equipment used in the study. When multiple measurements were made on the same ear, the average from those measurements was used in the calculation across subjects for a given study. Some subjects have measurements on both a right and a left ear, and some subjects have measurements from only one ear; this figure includes every ear in the database and does not control for the effect of number of ears from each subject.”\nfilter for only the 12 studies shown in Figure 1 (and also for frequencies shown in Figure 1)\nstudy the patterns of frequencies. It seems that most researchers used the same set of frequencies for each subject, ear, and session.\nnote the scale of the x-axis\nthe key labels contain AuthorsShortList, Year, and Instrument, in addition to the number of unique ears (I think Werner’s N may be incorrect?)\n\nStarter Code:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(mdsr)\nlibrary(dbplyr)\nlibrary(DBI)\n\nlibrary(RMariaDB)\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(\n  MariaDB(), host = \"scidb.smith.edu\",\n  user = \"waiuser\", password = \"smith_waiDB\", \n  dbname = \"wai\"\n)\nMeasurements &lt;- tbl(con, \"Measurements\")\nPI_Info &lt;- tbl(con, \"PI_Info\")\nSubjects &lt;- tbl(con, \"Subjects\")\n\n# collect(Measurements)\n\nRun the following queries in a chunk with {sql, connection = con}:\n\nSHOW TABLES;\nDESCRIBE Measurements;\nSELECT * FROM PI_Info LIMIT 0,1;",

    "title": "Intro to GitHub",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Version Control (GitHub)\nIn order to collaborate on an R project (or any coding project in general), data scientists typically use a version control system like GitHub. With GitHub, you never have to save files as Final.docx, Final2.docx, Newfinal.docx, RealFinal.docx, nothisisreallyit.docx, etc. You update code like .qmd and .Rmd and data files, recording descriptions of any changes. Then if you ever want to go back to an earlier version, GitHub can facilitate that. Or if you want to make your work public, others can see it and even suggest changes, but you are ultimately in control of any changes that get made.\nAnd, you can have multiple collaborators with access to the same set of files. While it can be dicey if multiple people have the file open and make changes at the same time; if you do this with GitHub, it is at least POSSIBLE to get it straightened out, and the second person who tries to save will get warned. If you are both just using a common folder on RStudio, you can easily write over and erase each other’s work. (If you use a common folder, be sure that one person is editing at a time to prevent this).\nIn order to begin to get familiar with GitHub, we will use it to create a course folder for you.\n\n\nGetting started on GitHub and connecting to RStudio\n\nCreate a GitHub account at github.com. It’s usually okay to hit “Skip Personalization” at the bottom of the screen after entering an email, username, and password (you might have to enable 2-factor authentication as well). There are a few bonuses you can get as a student that you might consider.\n\nYou may choose to use a non-St. Olaf email address to ensure you’ll have access to your GitHub account after you graduate.\n\nObtain a personal access token (PAT) in GitHub using the following steps:\n\nClick your profile picture/symbol in the upper right of your GitHub page. Then select Settings &gt; Developer settings &gt; Personal access tokens &gt; Tokens (classic).\nClick “Generate new token (classic)” and give a descriptive name like “My PAT for RStudio”. Note that the default expiration is 30 days; I did a Custom setting through the end of the semester.\nSelect scopes and permissions; I often select: repo, workflow, gist, and user.\nClick “Generate token”. Copy your personal access token and store it somewhere.\n\nStore your credentials in RStudio using the following steps:\n\nIn the console, type library(credentials). You might have to install the credentials package first.\nThen type set_github_pat() and hit Return. You can sign in with the browser, or you can choose the Token option, where you can copy in your personal access token\n\n\nAlert! If the steps in (3) don’t work, you may have to install Git on your computer first. This chapter in “Happy Git with R” provides nice guidance for installing Git. Installing Git for Windows seems to work well on most Windows machines, using this site seems to work well for macOS, and a command like sudo apt-get install git can often work nicely in Linux. Once Git is installed, restart RStudio, and it will usually magically find Git. If not, there’s some good advice in this chapter of “Happy Git with R”. If you ever get frustrated with Git, remember that No one is giving out Git Nerd merit badges! Just muddle through until you figure out something that works for you!\n\n\nCreating an R project (local) that’s connected to GitHub (cloud)\n\nIn your GitHub account, click the \\(+ \\nabla\\) (+down arrow) button near the top right and select New Repository (repo). Put something like “SDS264_F24” for your repository (repo) name; use simple but descriptive names that avoid spaces. Check Private for now; you can turn a repository Public if you want later. Check Add a ReadMe File. Finally hit Create Repository and copy the URL once your repo has been created; the URL should be something like github.com/username/SDS264_F24.\nGo into your RStudio and select File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git. For the repository URL paste in the URL for the repository you just created. A project directory named “SDS264_F24” will be created in your specified folder (which you can navigate to).\n\nNotice that you are now starting with a blank slate! Nothing in the environment or history. Also note where it says your project name in the top right corner.\nAt this point your should have a GitHub repo called “SDS264_F24” connected to an R project named “SDS264_F24”. The basic framework is set!\nHere is an illustration (source) of the process of using GitHub to manage version control and collaboration, followed by greater detail about each step:\n\n\n\nCreating new files in RStudio (local)\n\nYou can download our first file with in-class exercises here. Just hit the Download Raw File button and note where the file is saved on your computer. Use File &gt; Open File in RStudio to open up 01_review164.qmd. Then, use File &gt; Save As to navigate to the SDS264_F24 folder on your computer and save a copy there. You can even add your name or a few answers and re-save your file.\n\n\n\nMaking sure the connection to GitHub is ready\n\n[If necessary] You may need one of these two steps when using GitHub for the first name in a new R Project, even though you likely did them while installing GitHub.\n\nIn the console, type library(credentials). Then type set_github_pat(), hit Return, and copy in your personal access token.\nIn the Terminal window (this should be the tab next to Console), type the following two lines (be precise with the dashes and spaces!!):\n\n\n\ngit config --global user.name \"YOUR USER NAME\"\n\n\ngit config --global user.email \"YOUR EMAIL ASSOCIATED WITH GITHUB\"\n\n\n\nPushing your work to GitHub (cloud)\n\nWe now want to “push” the changes made in 01_review164.qmd to your GitHub repo (the changes have only been made in your local RStudio for now).\n\nunder the Git tab in the Environment panel, check the boxes in front of all modified files to “stage” your changes. To select a large number of files, check the top box, scroll down to the bottom of the list, and then shift-click the final box\nclick the Commit tab to “commit” your changes (like saving a file locally) along with a message describing the changes you made. GitHub guides you by by showing your old code (red) and new code (green), to make sure you approve of the changes. This first time, all code should be green since we’ve only added new things rather than modifying previously saved files.\n“push” your changes to GitHub (an external website) by clicking the green Up arrow. Refresh your GitHub account to see new files in the user_name.github.io repo!\n\n\n\n\nModifying files that have already been pushed to GitHub\n\nMake and save a change (anything) to your file 01_review164.qmd in RStudio. Now go back under the Git tab and “push” these new changes to GitHub. You’ll have to go through the same process of Stage, Commit, and Push, although this time you’ll see only your newest changes in green when you Commit. Confirm that your changes appear in GitHub.\n\n\n\nPulling work from GitHub\nBefore you start a new session of working on a project in RStudio, you should always Pull changes from GitHub first. Most of the time there will be nothing new, but if a collaborator made changes since the last time you worked on a file, you want to make sure you’re working with the latest and greatest version. If not, you’ll end up trying to Push changes made to an old version, and GitHub will balk and produce Merge Conflict messages. We’ll see how to handle Merge Conflicts later, but it’s a bit of a pain and best avoided!\n\nGo into 01_review164.qmd on GitHub and hit the Edit icon. Add a line anywhere, and then scroll down to hit Commit Changes. (This is not recommended and for illustrative purposes only! You will likely never edit directly in GitHub, but we’re emulating what might happen if a collaborator makes changes since the last time you worked on a document.) Now go back to RStudio and, under the Git tab, “Pull” the changes from GitHub into your R project folder. (Use the blue Down arrow). Confirm that your changes now appear in RStudio. Before you start working on the R server, you should always Pull any changes that might have been made on GitHub (especially if you’re working on a team!), since things can get dicey if you try to merge new changes from RStudio with new changes on GitHub.\n\n\n\nA bit more about R projects\n\nTo see the power of projects, select File &gt; Close Project and Don’t Save the workspace image. Then, select File &gt; Recent Projects &gt; SDS264_F24; you will get a clean Environment and Console once again, but History shows the commands you ran by hand, active Rmd and qmd files appear in the Source panel, and Files contains the Rmd, qmd, html, and csv files produced by your last session. And you can stage, commit and push the changes and the new file to GitHub!",

    "text": "Ideally before class on Thurs Sep 5, and definitely before class on Tues Sep 10, you should follow these instructions to set up the software that we’ll be using throughout the semester. Even if you’ve already downloaded both R and RStudio, you’ll want to re-download to make sure that you have the most current versions.\n\nRequired: Download R and RStudio\n\nFIRST: Download R here.\n\nIn the top section, you will see three links “Download R for …”\nChoose the link that corresponds to your computer.\nAs of July 24, 2024, the latest version of R is 4.4.1 (“Race for Your Life”).\n\nSECOND: Download RStudio here.\n\nClick the button under step 2 to install the version of RStudio recommended for your computer.\nAs of July 24, 2024, the latest version of RStudio is 2024.04.2 (Build 764).\n\nTHIRD: Check that when you go to File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory, you see “Quarto Website” as an option.\n\n\nSuggested: Watch this video from Lisa Lendway at Macalester describing key configuration options for RStudio.\n\nSuggested: Change the default file download location for your internet browser.\n\nGenerally by default, internet browsers automatically save all files to the Downloads folder on your computer. In that case, you have to grab files from Downloads and move them to a more appropriate storage spot. You can change this option so that your browser asks you where to save each file before downloading it.\nThis page has information on how to do this for the most common browsers.\n\n\nRequired: Install required packages.\n\nAn R package is an extra bit of functionality that will help us in our data analysis efforts in a variety of ways. Many contributors create open source packages that can be added to base R to perform certain tasks in new and better ways.\nFor now, we’ll just make sure the tidyverse package is installed. Open RStudio and click on the Packages tab in the bottom right pane. Click the Install button and type “tidyverse” (without quotes) in the pop-up box.
